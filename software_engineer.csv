That’s why we are building a new way to learn, earn, and exchange crypto assets. Before coming together, we founded companies, built amazing fintech products, and raised capital with some of the world’s best.What We Are BuildingWe are building an easy-to-use crypto marketplace to help make mass adoption as seamless as possible for the next 900 million crypto users. Through multiple integrations and partnerships, our product provides one place to buy, earn, sell, and exchange crypto assets, decentralized finance (DeFi) tokens and protocols, and non-fungible tokens (NFTs). In addition to the buy, sell, exchange elements, we also provide a new kind of social-first crypto information platform that allows verified users to interact with one another in a way that will make creating and sharing better quality and higher value information easier.Why We Do ItThe revolution of code-based money and financial services will change the world — for the better. We want to help lead the charge and educate about how people can take more control of financial matters. We believe most of the world is still missing out on all of the opportunities in crypto and DeFi because these new technologies are still cumbersome to use. Accessing decentralized financial products shouldn’t require twenty steps.

That’s why we are building a new way to learn, earn, and exchange crypto assets. Before coming together, we founded companies, built amazing fintech products, and raised capital with some of the world’s best.What We Are BuildingWe are building an easy-to-use crypto marketplace to help make mass adoption as seamless as possible for the next 900 million crypto users. Through multiple integrations and partnerships, our product provides one place to buy, earn, sell, and exchange crypto assets, decentralized finance (DeFi) tokens and protocols, and non-fungible tokens (NFTs). In addition to the buy, sell, exchange elements, we also provide a new kind of social-first crypto information platform that allows verified users to interact with one another in a way that will make creating and sharing better quality and higher value information easier.Why We Do ItThe revolution of code-based money and financial services will change the world — for the better. We want to help lead the charge and educate about how people can take more control of financial matters.
